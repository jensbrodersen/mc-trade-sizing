# mc-trade-sizing
Monte Carlo simulations for dynamic position sizing based on trade sequences and risk analysis

This project analyzes trade sequences to optimize position sizing dynamically using Monte Carlo simulations.  
It evaluates the impact of varying position sizes based on trading streak behaviors and simulates performance under different market scenarios.  

## Features
- Monte Carlo simulation framework for trade outcome modeling  
- Dynamic position sizing strategies based on trade series analysis  
- Comparison of risk and return metrics under various assumptions  

## Purpose
To improve portfolio management by incorporating realistic trading behavior and sequence dependencies, moving beyond static position sizing methods.

## Usage
The code processes historical trade data, runs multiple simulations with varying parameters, and outputs detailed performance reports in HTML format.
