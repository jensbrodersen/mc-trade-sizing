# MC Trade Sizing - Docker Usage Guide

This repository provides a Docker image for running the **MC Trade Sizing** tool in a consistent and isolated environment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and properly configured on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- (Optional but recommended) Add your user to the Docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

> You may need to log out and back in or restart your shell for group changes to take effect.

## Usage

### 1. Pull the Docker Image

To download the latest image from Docker Hub, run:

```bash
docker pull jensbrodersen/mc-trade-sizing
```

### 2. Run the Container

You can run the container interactively and remove it after it exits using:

```bash
docker run -it --rm jensbrodersen/mc-trade-sizing
```

### 3. Save Output to Local Directory (Recommended)

To persist the results generated by the tool to your local system, use a volume mount:

```bash
docker run -v /home/your-username/results:/app/results jensbrodersen/mc-trade-sizing
```

Replace `/home/your-username/results` with the absolute path to your desired output directory.

## Output

The container writes result files to the `/app/results` directory inside the container. When using the volume mount, these files will be saved to your local directory for later analysis.

## Notes

- The Docker image is pre-configured and requires no additional setup.
- Ensure the output directory exists before running the container.
